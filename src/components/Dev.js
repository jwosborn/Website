          As mentioned in my "Where I came from" section, I intend my primary
          vocation to be a pastor. However, in so many churches, pastors have
          secular jobs as well. Once I started to realize this, I began to
          explore some career options that offer flexibility, certainty, as well
          as fulfillment! I searched for about a year and in late 2018, upon the
          advice of a good friend, started to explore software development.

          Like many people, I started with Treehouse to learn the most very
          basic principles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the bones on which sit
          much of the internet. Once I had a decent grasp of the basics, I
          started to build my own apps and explore frameworks and their power.
          At the time of writing I have experience in Vue.js, React (obviously),
          Laravel(PHP), and a little Golang.
