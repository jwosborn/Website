          I went to Olive Branch High School. Class of 2008. High School was a
          blast for me. I had a great group of friends and went to a great
          church. It was while I was in high school that I fell in love with the
          game of soccer. I played every second I wasn't asleep or eating. My
          senior year I was part of the All-Conference team and my team went to
          the Quarter-finals of the State Championship.
